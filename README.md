Challenge
=========

A repository of programming challenges and practice program for all languages. Some popular sites I find problems at are:

* http://projecteuler.net/
* http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer

project can vary but tend to be smaller problems that can be solved in just a couple days.
