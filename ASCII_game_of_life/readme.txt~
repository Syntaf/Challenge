ASCII Game of Life:This is called a cellular automaton. This means it is 
based on a 'playing field' of sorts, made up of lots of little cells or 
spaces. For Conway's game of life, the grid is square - but other shapes 
like hexagonal ones could potentially exist too. Each cell can have a 
value - in this case, on or off - and for each 'iteration' or loop of 
the game, the value of each cell will change depending on the other cells 
around it. This might sound confusing at first, but looks easier when you 
break it down a bit.
